# When a player has entered a profanity, this is how long time he/she is considered a recent "offender".
# Recent offender messages will be logged for this time period to see if they try to circumvent the blacklist system.
# This does not take into account the ProfanityLevel. This means that if you are an offender, then you will continue to be
# considered a recent offender if you use similar words to blacklisted words any time while you are an offender.
